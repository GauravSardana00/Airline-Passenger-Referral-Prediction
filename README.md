# Airline-Passenger-Referral-Prediction
This is the capstone project that I have done in Almabetter Data Science curriculum.All the models developed in this project will be heavily based on classification as binary dependent variable needs to be predicted.In this case model is predicting whether passenger will refer the airline to other or not.

# Introduction
Airline passenger referral prediction is a pivotal aspect in optimizing airline operations and enhancing customer experience. By leveraging predictive analytics, airlines can anticipate and understand passenger behavior, facilitating targeted marketing strategies and personalized services. Referral prediction entails analyzing various factors such as travel history, booking patterns, demographic information, and social interactions to forecast the likelihood of passengers referring the airline to others. This predictive insight enables airlines to tailor their services, loyalty programs, and promotional offers, ultimately fostering customer loyalty and increasing brand advocacy. In an industry where customer satisfaction and loyalty are paramount, effective referral prediction plays a crucial role in driving revenue growth and sustaining competitive advantage.
